                                    Tulane in 1930s America. He is self-centered, proud of his appearance, and emotionally detached, 
                                    despite Abilene's deep love for him. Abilene treats Edward like a cherished companion, but he feels
                                     no real affection in return. His world is secure and predictable, and he enjoys the admiration he

                                    bottom of the ocean, where he remains for almost a year, completely alone and forgotten, beginning 
                                    his long and painful transformation.</p>

                                    as if he were a real child. At first, Edward is annoyed, but he slowly begins to appreciate the
